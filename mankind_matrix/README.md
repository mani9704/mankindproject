## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Node.js (LTS version recommended)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [VS Code (optional)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Check installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
git --version
```

---


### (Optional) 2. Set Up React Project

> _Skip this if you're working directly from the existing repo. This command will create a new project where you can understand how to start from scratch a project, but for front-end development, we have everything created already, jump to step 3._

You can create a new React project using Create React App with the command below:

```bash
npx create-react-app your-project-name
cd your-project-name
npm start
```
---

### 3. Clone This Repository

To work with the **Mankind Matrix** project, clone the `master` branch:

```bash
git clone --branch master https://github.com/Nikhilbansal777/mankind_matrix
cd mankind_matrix
```

### 4. Environment Setup

The project requires environment variables to be set up before running. Follow these steps:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory
2. Copy the contents from `.env.example` to your new `.env` file
3. Update the variables as needed

The `.env.example` file contains all the necessary variables that the system needs to function properly.

### 5. Backend Connection

There are two ways to connect to the backend services:

#### Option 1: Using Deployed API (Recommended for Production)
